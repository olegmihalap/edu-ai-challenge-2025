## Code Review Results for `processUserData` and `saveToDatabase`

### 👨‍💻 Perspective 1: Experienced Developer

**Summary**  
The function is straightforward and readable but lacks modern JavaScript conventions and type safety. Code can be refactored to improve maintainability and clarity.

**Actionable Recommendations**
- Use `let` or `const` instead of `var` to improve scoping and readability.
- Add TypeScript types to the `data` parameter and `users` array for better type safety.
- Use `map()` instead of a `for` loop for a more functional and concise approach.
- Avoid in-function console logs for production environments—use a proper logging mechanism.
- Break the user transformation logic into a separate helper function for better reusability and testing.

### 🛡️ Perspective 2: Security Engineer

**Summary**  
The function lacks basic input validation and error handling. It assumes well-structured data and exposes potentially sensitive user data in logs.

**Actionable Recommendations**
- Validate the `data` input to ensure it is an array and contains valid user objects.
- Sanitize user inputs (e.g., escape or encode `name`, `email`) if they’re coming from untrusted sources.
- Remove or secure logging of potentially sensitive information like `email`.
- Add try-catch blocks to gracefully handle unexpected runtime issues.
- Secure the `saveToDatabase` stub with proper database sanitation and access control when implemented.

### ⚙️ Perspective 3: Performance Specialist

**Summary**  
The function is performant for small datasets but not optimized for scalability or memory use with large inputs.

**Actionable Recommendations**
- Use `const` for `users` and `user` to prevent accidental reassignment.
- Use `Array.prototype.map()` instead of manual `for` loop to improve performance and readability.
- Consider streaming or batch processing for very large datasets to reduce memory footprint.
- Avoid unnecessary ternary operation: `data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false` can be simplified to `data[i].status === 'active'`.

### ✅ Summary

The code works for simple use cases but needs improvements in readability, security robustness, and scalability. Applying modern JavaScript practices, validating inputs, and preparing for large-scale data handling will significantly enhance code quality.
