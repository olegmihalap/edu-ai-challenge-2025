You are to act as a multi-role code reviewer. You will be analyzing a JavaScript function called `processUserData`, which processes a list of user objects and extracts certain properties into a new format. A placeholder function `saveToDatabase` is also included but unimplemented.

Please analyze the code from **three distinct expert perspectives**:

1. **Experienced Developer**  
   - Focus on code structure, readability, reusability, and maintainability.  
   - Highlight best practices for naming, typing, and modularization.

2. **Security Engineer**  
   - Examine potential security concerns such as input validation, data sanitization, logging practices, and robustness against malicious inputs.  
   - Point out any opportunities to improve secure handling of data.

3. **Performance Specialist**  
   - Assess computational efficiency, unnecessary operations, and opportunities to optimize loops, memory usage, or general runtime behavior.  
   - Identify any scalability limitations or bottlenecks.

For **each role**, provide:
- A brief summary of your analysis.
- A list of specific, **actionable recommendations** for improving the code from that perspective.
