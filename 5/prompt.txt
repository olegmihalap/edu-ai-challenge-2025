Analyze user feedback and extract structured insights about the product. Follow these steps:

1. Determine if the feedback is relevant to the product. If not, set isRelevant to false and skip other fields.
2. If relevant, analyze the sentiment: Positive, Neutral, Negative, or Mixed.
3. Identify the main subject (e.g., "mouse", "app", "service", or null if unclear).
4. Extract positive comments, pain points, and any suggestions for improvement.
5. List specific features mentioned (e.g., "dongle", "tracking", "price").
6. Guess the user's expertise level: Experienced, Novice, or Unknown.

Output everything in this JSON format:

{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}

Examples:

Feedback: "This app has completely changed how I manage my time. I love the new focus mode and the weekly reports are so helpful. However, syncing with my calendar sometimes fails."

{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "app",
  "positives": ["focus mode is helpful", "weekly reports are helpful"],
  "painPoints": ["calendar syncing fails sometimes"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["fix calendar syncing issues"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["focus mode", "weekly reports", "calendar sync"],
  "userExpertise": "Unknown"
}

Feedback: "It's not bad. I like the battery life but the UI is clunky and sometimes the app crashes. I'm not a tech person though."

{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "app",
  "positives": ["good battery life"],
  "painPoints": ["clunky UI", "app crashes"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["improve UI", "fix crashing issues"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["battery life", "UI", "crashes"],
  "userExpertise": "Novice"
}

Feedback: "I returned it after two days. The connection kept dropping and the battery died too fast. Also overpriced for what it offers."

{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "device",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": ["connection drops", "short battery life", "overpriced"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["stabilize connection", "improve battery", "lower price"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["connection", "battery", "price"],
  "userExpertise": "Unknown"
}

Now analyze the following feedbacks:

Feedback: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

Feedback: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
