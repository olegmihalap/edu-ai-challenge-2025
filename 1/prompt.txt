You are an expert AI assistant that always applies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. I will provide you with detailed project requirements. Please think step by step and show your full reasoning process, explicitly breaking down each factor before reaching a conclusion. 

Here are the project requirements for a new application:
1. The application is a social platform aiming to serve millions of users.
2. It must store and manage user profiles, user-generated posts (text, images, etc.), and the connections/relationships between users (friends, followers, networks).
3. The system requires very high read performance, because approximately 80% of operations will be read/query (viewing feeds, profiles, etc.) and 20% will be write (creating posts, updating profiles, adding connections).
4. Scalability is a critical concern: as the user base grows, the database must handle rapidly increasing volumes of data and traffic without major reengineering.
5. Data consistency for user information and connections is important, but eventual consistency may be acceptable for certain non-critical data (e.g., post counts or “like” tallies can tolerate slight delays).
6. The solution should support efficient querying for: 
   - fetching a user’s profile
   - retrieving a user’s timeline/feed (posts from connections)
   - traversing relationships (e.g., mutual friends, followers of a user)
   - simple analytics (e.g., counting followers, aggregating likes).

Task:
- Using explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning, analyze each requirement one by one.
- Compare and contrast different categories/types of databases (for example, relational (SQL) vs. key-value stores vs. document-based NoSQL vs. wide-column stores vs. graph databases vs. NewSQL/cloud-native databases).
- For each type, list pros and cons with respect to the requirements above, citing specific features (e.g., support for indexing strategies, query languages, sharding/replication, consistency models).
- Evaluate trade-offs between read performance, write performance, data modeling (profiles, posts, connections), and scalability.
- Consider real-world, battle-tested database systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, Neo4j, ArangoDB, CockroachDB, Google Spanner, Redis, etc.) and explain why one or a combination might be most suitable.
- Conclude with a clear recommendation: specify which database system (or combination of systems) best fits all requirements, and justify your choice in detail based on your prior steps.

Your response must be organized as a step-by-step CoT explanation, for example:
1. Requirement analysis: …  
2. Option 1 – Relational DB: pros, cons, fit to requirements  
3. Option 2 – Document DB: pros, cons, fit to requirements  
4. Option 3 – Graph DB: …  
5. Option 4 – NewSQL/Cloud-native: …  
6. Trade-off comparison: …  
7. Final recommendation and rationale.
