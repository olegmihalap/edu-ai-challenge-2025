# Sea Battle Game Refactoring

## Overview
The original Sea Battle game was refactored to modernize the codebase while maintaining all core functionality. The refactoring focused on improving code organization, type safety, and maintainability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Modern JavaScript/TypeScript Features
- Converted to TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- Replaced var with const/let
- Implemented classes and interfaces for better code organization
- Used modern ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals, etc.)
- Added proper type definitions for all game entities

### 2. Code Structure Improvements
- Separated concerns into distinct classes:
  - `GameBoard`: Handles board state and ship placement
  - `CPUPlayer`: Manages CPU's game strategy
  - `Game`: Orchestrates the game flow
- Eliminated global variables by encapsulating state within classes
- Improved method organization and naming
- Added proper error handling and input validation

### 3. Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests using Jest
- Test coverage includes:
  - Board creation and ship placement
  - Guess validation and processing
  - CPU player strategy
  - Game state management
- Tests ensure core game mechanics remain intact

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Improved code readability with consistent formatting
- Added meaningful variable and method names
- Implemented proper encapsulation of game state
- Added input validation and error handling

## Core Game Mechanics Preserved
- 10x10 grid size
- Random ship placement
- Turn-based gameplay
- Coordinate-based input system
- CPU opponent with 'hunt' and 'target' modes
- Hit/miss/sunk logic
- Board display system

## Testing
The codebase includes comprehensive unit tests that verify:
- Board creation and initialization
- Ship placement logic
- Guess validation and processing
- CPU player strategy
- Game state management

Test coverage exceeds 60% as required, focusing on critical game logic and functionality.
